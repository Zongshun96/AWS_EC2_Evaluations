Note: use the main_script.py to get all plots. And data is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19bHYdxwkcyJ1AG61rOQJmzWSgeFBOZLm?usp=share_link).

I have the venv established so you can just load this repository to pycharm and everything should work.

main_script.py:
the main script, it calls all other functions

Hybrid_utils.py
SLS_utils.py
VM_utils.py
They are the entry point for price plot and progress plots.

plot_bar.py
plot_cdf.py
Basically the original code from you. some small changed to the plt.figure.
