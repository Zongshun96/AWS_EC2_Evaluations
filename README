I have the venv established so you can just load this repository to pycharm and everything should work.

main_script.py:
the main script, it calls all other functions

Hybrid_utils.py
SLS_utils.py
VM_utils.py
They are the entry point for price plot and progress plots.

plot_bar.py
plot_cdf.py
Basically the original code from you. some small changed to the plt.figure.
